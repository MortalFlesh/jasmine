# jasmine

- just a small app like example for me to better understand jasmine

## jasmine - data provider

- I am used to use data provider in PHPunit so I have been searching for some solution in jasmine
- but I found only this (https://github.com/jphpsf/jasmine-data-provider), problem is, this is just for jasmine v1.2
- so I updated it
- now you can use Jasmine 2.2.0 and use data providers just like that:
 
 ## Installation
 
 `npm install jasmine-data-provider`
 
 ## Usage
 
 `var using = require('jasmine-data-provider')`
